<h1>Introduction to Java Script</h1>
Simple writing JS code in a Chrome browser by clicking the left button of the mouse on the browser, click 'Inspect', click 'Console' and write js code

Creating your in browser js file, by being in the inspect view, click on 'Sources' menu, click on the '>>' button and click 'Snippets'. In there click on 'New snippet' and create
your new .js file.

The data types are as usual: numbers, strings and booleans.
<br />
Saving data can be done by using 'var'. 'var' is a keyword following with a 'name_of_the_var' = something.

For the type 'string' we have some extensions that we can use: length, slice(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase()
if we have var name = .... and we write name.length, it will print us the number of characters our string has. 
if we have var name = .... and we use name.slice(0, 5), it will show the string from the first(0) position to, but not including, 5th position.
if we have var name = .... and we use toUpperCase(), it will change the whole string to have only upper case characters.
same principle goes for the toLowerCase.

Like most programing languages JS, has Math.random(), which gives us a random number to a variable. The number is between 0 - 0.9999999999999999 or 0 inclusive to 1 excluded.

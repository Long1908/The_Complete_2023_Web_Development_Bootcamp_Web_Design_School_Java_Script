  <li><h1>Introduction to Java Script</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple writing JS code in a Chrome browser by clicking the left button of the mouse on the browser, click 'Inspect', click 'Console' and write js code

      <li>Creating your in browser js file, by being in the inspect view, click on 'Sources' menu, click on the '>>' button and click 'Snippets'. In there click on 'New snippet' and create
      your new .js file.

      <li>The data types are as usual: numbers, strings and booleans.
      Saving data can be done by using 'var'. 'var' is a keyword following with a 'name_of_the_var' = something.

      <li>For the type 'string' we have some extensions that we can use: length, slice(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase()
      if we have var name = .... and we write name.length, it will print us the number of characters our string has. 
      if we have var name = .... and we use name.slice(0, 5), it will show the string from the first(0) position to, but not including, 5th position.
      if we have var name = .... and we use toUpperCase(), it will change the whole string to have only upper case characters.
      same principle goes for the toLowerCase.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h1>Intermediate Java Script</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Like most programing languages JS, has Math.random(), which gives us a random number to a variable. The number is between 0 - 0.9999999999999999 or 0 inclusive to 1 excluded.</li>
      <li>In JS we have three types of comparators. The one we are going to look at is the "==" and "===". "===" checks not only if the value of two variables are equal, but their data type as well.
      "==" checks only if the values are equal. So if we compare a number 1 and a string "1" with ==, it will return true. </li>
      <li>Creating arrays in JS doesn't require you to specify how many elements are you gonna use or how many elements there is gnna be in the array. You can simply just write var name_of_the_array = 
      [...,...,...,..........]. The array comes with built in functionallity as well, such as 'includes()' which searches if an element exist in the array.
